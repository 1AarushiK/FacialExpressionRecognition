# Landmark-Driven-Facial-Expression-Recognition
A landmark-driven method on Facial Expression Recognition (FER). The module of FER is based on the SCN backbone proposed by the paper "[Suppressing Uncertainties for Large-Scale Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10392)".

Note that the module of FER is **not** the official implementation. All of the code can be only used for **research purposes**.
